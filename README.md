# duono
A pomodoro scheduler that lets you focus on your work.

## Usage

Add tasks using the left interface, and if the task starts with a number from 1 to 6 followed by a space it will be considered work, and will have a predefined color.

Click any calendar block to change its text, in which the number rule still applies, but now is more important since it means the node will play an alarm in the 25 and 30 minute mark, a pomodoro cycle.

You can reset the calendar through the js function  `resetCalendar()`

Cookies are used to save the calendar and tasks between visits
